# Command
`type`

# Alias
`get-content`

# Definition
Get the content of a file.

# Options
No options for this command.

# Examples

## Get the contents of a file
```powershell
PS C:\Temp> type .\myfile.txt
Hello there
```

## Alias of type: get-content
The command type is an alias of the command get-content in powershell. 
You can use get-content in the same way.


```powershell
PS C:\Temp> Get-Content .\myotherfile.txt
Here is some test text.
This is the second line.
This is the end of the file.
```

Because type is an alias of the get-content command, you can also use the same properties with type.

```powershell
PS C:\Temp> type -Path myotherfile.txt -Tail 1
This is the end of the file.
```
