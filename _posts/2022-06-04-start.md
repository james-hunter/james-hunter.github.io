## Start a program using its path

Most programs on a computer do not have their own shortcut, and you need to use the path in order to start the application.

`start 'D:\Data\Program Files\PFTP\pftp.exe'`

## Start a file with a particular program

Here I can open up a file with a program that I specify in the command.

`start .\test.txt notepad.exe`

## Open a URL with the default application

This example starts a webpage using the computer's default browser.

`start www.google.com`

# Manage the application shortcuts

## In Windows 11 settings

Open the Windows settings (shortcut `Win + I`) then in Application, then Other Settings, then Manage application execution aliases.

Here you can enable or disable aliases for applications. I suppose you would only do this is two apps have the same alias.

## In the registry

In powershell use these commands to create an alias for the Personal FTP server.
First create an item in the regedit.

`New-Item -Path 'HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths' -Name "pftp.exe"`

Then define the path.

`New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\pftp.exe\' -Name "Path" -Value "D:\Data\Program Files\PFTP"`

With the path is created the '(default)' property, which needs to contain the path to the executable file.

`Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\pftp.exe\' -Name "(default)" -Value "D:\Data\Program Files\PFTP\pftp.exe"`

Now I can use `pftp` or `pftp.exe` from the 'Run' dialogue.

In order to utilise this app path in the command line, it required a restart of my computer.

Note that `pftp.exe` alone fails: I need to write `start pftp.exe`.

Also, this change to the registry does not put my shortcut in the list of aliases in the settings.
