# Summary
Until today we have always used google or bing (or something else) to look up information that we need.

Today in the 20's we have a new tool: artificial intelligence, aka AI or LLM (large language model).

# How I use AI
For me, AI is today's google.

Practically, when I start work I open a browser and open a separate tab for each the sites listed above.

I make use of these sites because they don't require that I log in. I can ask unlimited questions.

When I need information, after accepting the cookies, I simply type in my question in human readable sentences and tap enter on my keyboard.

I take care to re-write personal or work-related information. For example:
* every name becomes: "John Smith"
* every company : "Contoso"
* other particulars become: "test"

# When to use which AI website?
Some AI is more specialised for certain questions.

It's an art to know what sites are better for what and that's why I have lots of sites open in different tabs. Different sites will give differing answers.

For example the free version of chatgpt I used in October 2025 did not know any current news information after 2021!

Another obvious limitation all these sites have is that the responses provided are not checked by humans before they show up on my screen. 

Still another thing to be mindful of is that the AI websites seem to be configured to hyperfocus on what you write about. The AI website might omit important context in its answer, although some do try to give context.

Since AI websites are not infallable, it's important to cross reference answers with:
* other AI sites,
* websites written with real human input (blogs, forums, wikis, etc),
* and of course real people.
