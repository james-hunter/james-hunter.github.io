# Command
`copy-item`

# Alias
`cp` and `copy`

# Definition
Copy an item.

# Options

`-Destination` to choose the path and name of the new copied file. Use this option with a pre-existing file to write over it. In this case you will not be asked to confirm the overwriting of the pre-existing file!

# Example

`Copy-Item .\myfile.txt -Destination .\myotherfile.txt`

In this example I create two files, each with different names and contents.

After creating the files, I copy one file making the destination a pre-existing filename. The file is copied and I check the contents of the copy to check.
