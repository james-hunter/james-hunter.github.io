# Sources
`whoami /?`

# Command
`whoami`

# Definition
This handy command shows you show the current user is.

It is great for using in a script, mostly when I want to see what rights the current user has.

# Options
* `/user` shows the user domain name and SID.
* `/groups` show the groups to which a user is a member.
* `/upn` only for a user in a domain, this option shows the user's principal name.
* `/fo` lets you specify the output format, including `csv` and `table`. 

# Example 1
I like to get data into a powershell object a quickly as possible so I can select and sort objects the way I'd like.

For this task I convert the original whoami data into csv data; then I can convert the csv data into a powershell object with `convertfrom-csv`.

```powershell
$whoami = whoami /user /fo csv | convertfrom-csv
```

# Example 2
Sometimes I want to see if the current user actually got added to some or other AD group.

```powershell
$groups = whoami /groups /fo csv | convertfrom-csv
```
