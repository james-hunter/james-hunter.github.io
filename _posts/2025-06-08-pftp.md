# Summary
While working in IT tech support, or while working on personal projects, I often come across the need to transmit files.

This little blog describes how I use the personal FTP server aka PFTP.

# FTP server or FTP client?
An FTP server is where you put files and from where you get files.

An FTP client puts the files or gets the files.

# FTP clients
If the PFTP is an FTP server, then which devices would be FTP clients? Well lots of devices, such as:
* Other Windows computers,
* Network routers and switches,
* Android devices.

These devices I list all have lots of other methods for exchanging files. It is right to question if it's so useful to use FTP for transmitting files. Reasons to use FTP might be:
* Other protocols are blocked by your network,
* Other protocols are just not supported by some operating systems or apps.

FTP is just another tool at your disposal.

# Install and Configure the PFTP
Download the PFTP from the link at the top of this page, and run the setup.

To configure, go to Options, then Users. Prepare a user account by entering in a line with:
* User
* Password
* Home directory
* Rights (r/w/a)

# Using the PFTP
The PFTP has a status screen which shows if the PFTP server is running.

It shows the IP address to which you can connect.

To connect to your PFTP, go to your FTP client and navigate to IP address of the server. You will be prompted to enter the user details.

In Windows file explorer, I can use the address: `ftp://192.168.2.100`. This address would also work with an internet browser.

# Firewall
If the PFTP is not working you may need to allow the PFTP to pass your firewall.

In Windows, you would go to the settings, then search for 'firewall' then look for the option to allow an application to pass the firewall.
