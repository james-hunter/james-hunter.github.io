# Summary
Modern software licenses encourage and often require coders to make their code freely available.

If you're used to using a simple execitable file to run a program, using code might seem intimidating.

This blog gives a brief example of using code from github with `git clone`.

I assume you already have git bash installed in your shell.

# Finding code
Today, LLM websites like copilot.microsoft can be used like google.com to find code projects.

I asked copilot:

```bash
Is there an API to query data from the UK pop music charts?
```

In response I got a link to this project on github: [github.com](https://github.com/datamgmt/Music-Chart-Downloader.git).

# Accessing code
I went to the link, and read the README.md file to see if it's what I wanted. To install the code I did the following:

```bash
cd Documents
git clone https://github.com/datamgmt/Music-Chart-Downloader.git
```

I did try to  run a code but it failed, however a quick check online for the error gave me the fix which I did:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

# Using the code
Now I can use the examples from the README.me file:

```bash
~/Documents/Music-Chart-Downloader/mcd.py --chart uk-singles --startdate 20031201 --enddate 20031231 --output_type json --output_set weekly
```

# Result
The code has created the data requested, which is of in json format.

Now that the data is available I can parse it how I like, but that is another topic.
