# Command
`sudo netplan apply`

# Definition
Use `sudo netplan apply` to set the network configuration on an ubuntu system.

# Configuration file
The network configuration file is located here: `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml`.

View which configuration files are available using this command:

```bash
sudo ls -ltr /etc/netplan/*.yaml
```

# Example
You might care about `netplan` when your ubuntu server doesn't get an IP address.

View the IP address with: 

```bash
sudo ip --brief a s
```

If you don't see an IP address in this output, look at the netplan configuration to see if it correct.

```bash
sudo vi /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
```

The most basic DHCP enabled configuration looks like this. Take the ethernet name (`ens33` in my case) form the earlier command.

The configuration file makes use of indentations.
```bash
network:
    renderer: networkd
    version: 2
    ethernets:
      ens33:
        dhcp4: true
```

After saving the configuration file, apply the configuration with:

```bash
sudo netplan apply
```

Now the ubuntu server should get an IP address from your DHCP server. 

The blog referenced at the top shows how to set a static IP address in an ubuntu server.
