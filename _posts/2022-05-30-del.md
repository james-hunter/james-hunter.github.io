# Command
`del`

# Alias
`remove-item`

# Definition
Remove an item.

# Options

`-Confirm:$False` will prevent the alert message, so you can delete without having to confirm it.

`-Recurse` is used to delete the item and its child items. 
If you use `-Confirm:$False` without `-Recurse` then you will still be prompted to confirm the deletion of child items.

`-Erroraction` aka `-ea` is used to define how the command should behave if there is an error. If you leave this command out the default behaviour is usually to give an error message, and the command is not completed.

`-Force` is used to delete files which are hidden or read only.

# Example

`del Readme.txt`

# Example

`del .'\VGA Utility_Intel.100.3370.0_W11x64_A\' -Confirm:$false -Force -Recurse`
