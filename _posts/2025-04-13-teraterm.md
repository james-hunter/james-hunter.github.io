# Summary
Tera term is a useful terminal emulation program.

I like to use it because it quickly detects my serial ports.

There are a couple of configurations that I like to use to make my user experience more comfortable.

# Tera term configuration 
## File location
Tera term's configuraion file is located here in Windows:
```powershell
start notepad "C:\Program Files (x86)\teraterm\TERATERM.INI"
```

## Font
For me I set the font to size 22. 
```powershell
;	Font
VTFont=Noto Mono,0,22,255
```

## Bell/Beep
I de-activate the bell sound here:
```powershell
; Beep by BEL (on/off/visual)
Beep=off
```

## Clear screen on resize
I prefer to keep the screen text after resizing the zindoz.
```powershell
; Clear screen when window is resized
ClearOnResize=off
```

## Number pad / * - +
I like using the number pad to type IP addresses and interfaces. The slash is not actually active on Tera term on my machine by default.

I resort to this key combination:  `SHIFT` `/`
